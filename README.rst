Boost.Build Toolset Tester
==========================

The project contains a Boost.Build project intended to test a
Boost.Build toolset.  To do this, it attempts to build components of C
and C++ programs (libraries, programs, object files, etc.) in all the
ways that a toolset must to satisfy the Boost.Build architecture.

It is intended to be useful for bare metal cross-compilers as well as
normal toolsets.
